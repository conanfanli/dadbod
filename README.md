## Macro Workout Strategies

I want to list a few standard routine workouts. Each workout is featured by
a few stapled exercises.

For example, a power workout should feature speed and/or plyometrics;
a lower body strength workout may feature deadlifts.
A upper body pump/strength workout may feature shoulder, chest and back.

Sample routine:

### Monday gameday:

- Isometrics: single leg hold, side bridge, calf hold/raise
- Ploymetrics (feature): box/depth jumps
- Single leg RDL
- Nordic curl
- Box breathing
- Farmer carry
- 10 min light cardio
- Medicine ball throw

### Tuesday recovery:

- rotational, core
- Isometrics (feature): plank, glute/abductor hold
- light cardio
- Massage, foam rolling, stretch
- Cold plunge, sauna
- Upper body pump: chest, biceps, triceps, back
- Box breathing (feature)
- Inversion
- BFR

### Wednesday heavy:

- Deadlift variations: sumo, RDL, trapbar, unilateral etc...
- Bent-over row
- 1 RPM machine bench
- Box breathing

### Thursday plyometrics:

Mostly same as Monday but swap similar excercises.

Can add weighted explosive movements and short range impulses.

### Friday recovery:

Mostly same as Tuesday

### Saturday heavy

Same as Wednesday but may swap deadlifts for squats.
Can swap back with shoulder exercises

### Sunday rest/walk
